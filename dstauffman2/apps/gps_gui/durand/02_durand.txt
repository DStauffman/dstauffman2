The history of aeronautics at Stanford began long before the founding of the department and is almost as old as the university itself. It started with the appointment of William F. Durand in 1904, only a year after the first flight of Wilbur and Orville Wright.

Today on the occasion of the half centenary of the department, modern flight systems and space systems continue to be two of the most important technology pillars that support a worldwide aerospace enterprise that fuels economic growth, brings together people and cultures, strengthens national security, enables the study of the whole Earth and supports the exploration of distant worlds.
