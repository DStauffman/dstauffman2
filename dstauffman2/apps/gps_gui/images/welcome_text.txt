Welcome to Stanford University.  This is your e-tour guide, Jason.  I will be guiding you around campus today with a little bit of your help.  We will visit the various locations shown to you on the campus map in the upper right hand corner of the screen.  As we approach these points of interest, you will be shown various related images and hear some interesting facts from me.  The screen in front of you also offers a variety of utilities: this software will show you distances to the points of interest and also guide you with left and right directions to the next point of interest.  With the buttons at the bottom, you can stop and reset the tour at any time.  You do the walking and I'll do the talking.  Let's go.
